# Flight Delay EDA — README

## Project Overview
Flight delays are a major challenge in aviation. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, important factors contributing to delays, and insights for predictive modeling.

## Objectives
- Understand dataset structure and quality  
- Identify key delay-related variables  
- Perform cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore correlations and patterns  
- Visualize trends across airlines, airports, seasons  
- Generate insights for future modeling  

## Dataset Description
Common fields:
- Flight_ID  
- Airline  
- Origin/Destination Airport  
- Scheduled & Actual Times  
- Departure/Arrival Delays  
- Distance  
- Date fields  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  

## Steps in Notebook
1. Import Libraries  
2. Load Dataset  
3. Initial Exploration  
4. Cleaning (missing data, datatypes, outliers)  
5. EDA and Visualization  
6. Key Insights  
7. Conclusion & Next Steps
